I am currently a final-year PhD student at School of Informatics in University of Edinburgh, I am supervised by  Prof. [Tiejun Ma](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/tiejun-ma) and Prof. [Jane Hillston](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jeh/). Before that, I completed a BSc in Mathematics at Lanzhou University and an MSc in Statistics and Operational Research at University of Edinburgh. My PhD work focus on building scalable and efficent distributed network via optimization methods. In my research, I have applied various operational research (OR) ideas and methods to optimize parallel distributed consensus network, which is primarily used in blockchain.

My research interests lie generally in the intersection of OR and AI. I am particularly interested in exploring the use of deep neural network methods to address traditional OR challenges such as inventory control, logistics, and revenue management. Additionally, I am fascinated by the potential integration of blockchain technology with decentralized AI. If you share similar interests or are open to research discussions and potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me.

I intend to pursue my academic and will be seeking postdoctoral positions in the near future. 

News
=====
* I will present my work at the the 33rd European Conference on Operational Research in Copenhagen. Welcome to meet me offline for research discussions or casual chats!

My life
=====
Besides research, I frequently play badminton and previously served as the captain of the school team during my undergraduate studies. Musically, I enjoy playing the violin (amateur level 10). I have performed multiple times at the university's welcome parties.

I am also a football enthusiast and a devoted fan of Real Madrid. Addtionally, I have a interest in chess (though I haven't played for years) and won fifth place in a city-level amateur competition during my childhood.
