I am currently a final-year PhD student at School of Informatics in University of Edinburgh, I am supervised by  Prof. [Tiejun Ma](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/tiejun-ma) and Prof. [Jane Hillston](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jeh/). Before that, I completed a BSc in Mathematics at Lanzhou University and an MSc in Statistics and Operational Research at University of Edinburgh. My PhD work focus on **building scalable and efficient distributed network via optimization methods**. For this topic, I have applied stochastic optimization methods to enhance the performance of parallel Byzantine consensus network, which is primarily used in blockchain.

My research interests lie primarily in **OR** and **AI**, leveraging methodologies from **optimization**, **deep learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **statistics**. I am particularly focused on **optimization and decision-making under uncertainty** in the context of distributed networks, supply chain management, multimodal learning, and large language models.

I am always open to discussions! If you share similar research interests or would like to explore collaboration opportunities, please feel free to reach out.

I am seeking **postdoctoral positions** to continue my academic journey.

News
=====
I will present my work at the the 33rd **European Conference on Operational Research** in Copenhagen. Welcome to meet me offline for research discussions or casual chats!

My life
=====
Besides research, I frequently play badminton and previously served as the captain of the school team during my undergraduate studies. Musically, I enjoy playing the violin (amateur level 10). I have performed multiple times at the university's welcome parties.

I am also a football enthusiast and a devoted fan of Real Madrid. Addtionally, I have a interest in chess (though I haven't played for years) and won fifth place in a city-level amateur competition during my childhood.
